SDD Software Design Document. (including Design Considerations)

Each Gps marker tag can contain an instance of a Change-, Navigation marker.

During read of a route file we need a unique key to link Navigation- and Change markers to Gps markers. 
Two options:

1) Use distance: 
	- Recompute distance of all markers, sometimes more than 4000, when one marker is moved, added or deleted.
    - Distances are not always unique.
	- AR3 Markers with same distance can have different LatLng coordinates!
2) Use LatLng:
   ++ No recomputation of distance is needed when mouse moves a marker.
	- Make Unique LatLng during read of Nav- and change markers using Dictionary key-value pair.
