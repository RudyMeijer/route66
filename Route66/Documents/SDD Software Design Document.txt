SDD Software Design Document. (including Design Considerations)

1) Each Gps marker tag can contain an instance of a Change- or Navigation class.

2) During reading route file we need a unique key to link Navigation- and Change markers to Gps markers. 
   Two options:

	a) Use distance: 
		- Recompute distance of all markers when one marker is moved, added or deleted. sometimes more than 4000.
		- Distances are not always unique in ar3 files.
		- AR3 Markers with same distance can have different LatLng coordinates!
	b) Use LatLng:
	   ++ No recomputation of distance is needed when mouse moves a marker.

	Make LatLng unique during read of Nav- and Change markers using Dictionary key-value pair.
	Make distance unique during write of Nav- and Change markers by adding 1 cm.
